##Assignment

There were two tasks, each of them you can find in the following 
packages:
```
it-jim
└─── corr
│   │   __init__.py
│   │   corr_lab.ipynb
|
└─── bounds
    │   __init__.py
    │   bounds_lab.ipynb
```
1. ```__init__.py``` contains complete solution
2. It is **highly recommended** checking out ```.ipynb``` files because 
the majority of all assumptions and tries are there.
